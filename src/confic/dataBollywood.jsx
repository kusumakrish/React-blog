When circumstances put everything he cares for at stake, including Neelu who he loves, Montu is forced to do what he's never done- TEACH. Through his journey, the film humorously addresses the value of Sports Education in school curriculum.",

        description:"The entire movie can be described as a mix of parts equally bad and good. With a premise very similar to the slightly better 'Vairam', there is much potential at disposal which is not efficiently harnessed by veteran S.N.Swami's script. Mohanlal plays the cameo to perfection but the role is given more importance than it is due thereby sidelining the major issue of the movie. Suresh Gopi shines with a believable performance but the transition to the vigilante is not sketched out effectively. Harisree Ashokan, Biju Menon and Mohini phones it in while Vijayaraghavan has a few scene stealing moments which he does with aplomb. The movie also skims over the serious issue it deals with just as a framework for a thriller which is unfortunate, in my opinion, as it is a major one in the real world now. An average thriller which may work for you if you don't have much expectations from a Mohanlal-Suresh Gopi movie, which is hardly true in my case.",

        description:"Here is a movie that makes you sit up and take notice of a brilliant director, who entered the film stream as music director. Vishal's progress as a director is astounding!The film is adapted from Shakeaspere's Macbeth, using Mumbai underworld as the backdrop. Charecterizations are brillaint, with the witches in Macbeth, being metamorphosed into two corrupt cops.The screenplay, cinematography, sound design are dialogues are brilliant. The performances from all the 5 key players, Irrfan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapur, and the two cops, Naseer and Om Puri are out of the world. Music is imaginative with captive visualizations.Credit for the entire movie should go to Vishal, for his outstanding conceptualization and execution. A special word, for cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi. His final shot of Irrfan falling on the ground in the hospital, with a slow motion of a pigeon, followed by a changing color from normal light to serene green, followed by the fall with a tilted camera is worth going miles for! Bravo!",
