        description:"Cycling habitually, especially at a high intensity, can help lower your body fat levels, which promotes healthy weight management (1).Additional studies suggest that including sprint and strength training with regular cycling may temporarily increase your metabolism and build muscle, which allows you to burn more calories, even while at rest (2).Cycling improves overall function in your lower body and strengthens your leg muscles without overstressing your joints. It targets your quads, glutes, hamstrings, and calves.To make your legs even stronger and enhance your cycling performance, try doing weightlifting exercises, such as squats, leg presses, and lunges, a few times per week (3Trusted Source).",

        title:"Should you try dance fitness?",
        description:"Fitness enthusiasts have been burning up the dance floor for years, rockin' off the calories to the sound of heart-pumping tunes and easy-to-master moves. Dance fitness instructors constantly adapt their choreography and develop new classes inspired by styles ranging from hip-hop and Latin dance to ballroom and ballet.One of the best things about dance fitness classes is that they're accessible to almost all fitness levels. They also provide an easy and fun way for people to get active with a wide variety of offerings.What Is Dance Fitness? Dance fitness stands out from technical or traditional dance in that technique and intricate choreography aren't the main focus. Participants don't spend months perfecting a routine in anticipation of a show or recital; rather, they show up, work up a sweat while doing their best to follow an instructor, and leave feeling good about their workout..",

        title:"Easy Exercises for Kids",
        description:"Exercise for kids should be fun. Instead of working out, think of it as exercise play. Thats the term used by Ewunike Akpan, a personal trainer certified by the American Council on Exercise and the associate manager for the mid-Atlantic region for BOKS (Build Our Kids' Success).BOKS is a school-based fitness program for elementary and middle school kids, and it's all about fun and games. Kids arrive at school about 45 minutes early and spend that time in fun, active play. Its a fantastic way to add fitness to their daily routine. And it helps them do better in school, both academically and behaviorally, too.1 What follows are suggestions for easy exercises for kids—movements and games that they'll enjoy and benefit from. These ideas require no equipment or large outdoor spaces. They can be done in small bursts of five to 10 minutes, or you can string several activities together for a longer physical playtime.Start with a few minutes of warm-up exercises to get muscles and hearts moving.",

        description:"Machines and cables and dumbbells, oh my! The gym floor is chock-full of equipment to choose from, but where should you start? Although machines have their place — they’re great for beginners as they assist with form and allow you to lift heavier — free weights can give you more bang for your buck.Free weights include any weight you can pick up and move around, such as dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells.Unlike machines, where the movement — and you — are fixed, free weights allow you to work in any range of motion you’d like. This requires you to work against gravity and use those stabilizer muscles to engage.Below, we’ve curated 15 free-weight exercises for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Are you ready to get lifting?",
